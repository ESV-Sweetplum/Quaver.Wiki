# Quaver Plugins

Quaver Plugins are visual extensions of the editor, which allow you to automate or simplify map-making. Quaver uses [lua](https://www.lua.org/), an embedded programming language, to run plugins. 

## Plugin examples

There are many types of plugins, from quality-of-life to object placement. Some examples are:

- [amoguSV](https://github.com/kloi34/amoguSV): An all-purpose SV generation plugin.
- [VanillaChinchilla](https://github.com/kloi34/VanillaChinchilla) - Efficiently modify or create batches of notes.
- [Note Counter](https://steamcommunity.com/sharedfiles/filedetails/?id=2607291545): A visualizer for hand biases and column distribution.

Plugin concepts are endless, as Quaver uses [Dear ImGui](https://github.com/ocornut/imgui), a graphical library with all sorts of inputs, visuals, and more.

## Making your own plugins

If you want to make your own plugins, you can get started [here](/docs/plugins/getting_started). The plugin guide assumes you have basic knowledge of coding, as well as Lua syntax.
